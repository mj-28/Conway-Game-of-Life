# Conway's Game of Life

This is a python implementation of Conway's Game of Life using NumPy and Matplotlib
The simulation follows the standard rules of the cellular automaton and updates all cells synchronously at each time step. The grid is visualised using Matplotlib animations.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
